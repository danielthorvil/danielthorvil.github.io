## Issue

I have an Azure MPN subscription where i get free credits each month through a visual studio subscription. I was trying to provision Azure Synapse Analytics and kept getting the same error. I tried 5 different locations.

Error message:

```plaintext
{
    "status": "Failed",
    "error": {
        "code": "ValidationFailed",
        "message": "Workspace request validation failed, check error details for more information",
        "details": [
            {
                "code": "SqlServerRegionDoesNotAllowProvisioning",
                "message": "Location 'westus2' is not accepting creation of new Windows Azure SQL Database servers for the subscription 'XXX' at this time."
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Solution

I didn't have to right resource providers registered. Go into your subscription and make sure that all of the following resource providers are registered, and that the location you want to deploy to is supported.

Resource providers you probably want to enable, if you are doing Azure Synapse Analytics:

*   Microsoft.Sql
*   Microsoft.Synapse
*   Microsoft.Compute
*   Microsoft.Storage
