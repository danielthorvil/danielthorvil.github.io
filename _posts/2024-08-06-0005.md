## Intro

I had to find the calendar ID for the default calendar in a Microsoft 365 group / Teams group, because i needed to list the events in the calendar programmatically. I used way to much time googling, so i figured i would make a short post showing the different graph resources for getting calendars.

The graph resource /me/calendar allows you to get your calendars, but it did not show me the MS365 group calendar.

The next thing i tried was /me/calendarGroups, but again it did not show me what i was looking for.

The solution was to use the /groups/{id}/calendar graph resource.
